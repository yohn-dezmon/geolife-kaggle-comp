Logistic Regression vs. SVM:
- SVM can handle non-linear solutions whereas logistic regression can only 
handle linear solutions.
- linear SVM handles outliers better, as it dervies maximum margin solution 
- hinge loss in SVM outperforms log loss in LR 

^ hm ok looks like SVM is typically the better option then?

Logistic Regression vs KNN:
- KNN is a non-parametric model, where LR is a parametric model.
^ What does that mean?
- KNN is comparatively slower than Logistic Regression
- KNN supports non-linear solutions...
- LR can derive confidence level (about its prediction), whereas KNN can 
only output labels.

KNN vs SVM:
- SVM takes care of outliers better than KNN.
- if training data is much larger than number of features (m >> n) then 
KNN is better than SVM. SVM outperforms KNN when there are large features 
and lesser training data.
