predict the localization of plant and animal species.
1.6M geo-localized observations from France and the US of 17K species 
are provided. (9K plant species and 8K animal species).

the observations are paired with aerial images and environmental features 
around them.

goal:
- for each GPS position in the test set, return a set of candidate species 
that should contain the true observed species.

Evaluation:
- top-30 error rate 
- each observation i is associated with a single ground-truth label y_i
corresponding to the observed species.
- for each observation, the submissions will provide 30 candidate labels
y_i,1 --> y_i,30
- 

This is CATEGORICAL. It either IS or ISNT the species.

Train/test split:
- limit the spatial bias 
- spatial block holdout procedure
- 

all observations are assigned into a grid of 5kmx5km quadrats.

What's a quadrat?

2.5% == test set 
97.5% == training set 

a validation set built using the same splitting procedure is provided 
(column  `subset` of `observations_*_train.csv`)

How to choose which categorical model to use?
- logistic regression
- knn
- support vector machine 
- PCA (?) (is this even categorical)?
- CNN


Submission format:
- a CSV file containing two columns for each observation 
Id -- containing integers corresponding to the observations ids 
Predicted -- column containing space-delimited lists of 30 predicted labels 
made for each observation.
